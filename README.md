# Modeling Collective Behavior in Ants

## Abstract
To research ants’ behavior, we can create and observe a model rather than do field observations. This paper aims to use the ABM model to simulate ants’ behavior. In addition, compare with the mathematical model mentioned in [Zachery Shaffer 2013]. This paper discovers that the ABM simulation may be better than the ODE model. Furthermore, this paper does many experiments to discuss what factors may affect the simulation result.
